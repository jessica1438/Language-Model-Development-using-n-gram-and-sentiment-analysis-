# Language-Model-Development-using-n-gram-and-sentiment-analysis-

The repository includes two main sections. The first part focuses on developing a language model using uni-gram, bi-gram, and n-gram approaches utilizing the 'lang_modelingdata.txt' file. The analysis includes statistics such as the number of sentences, vocabulary length, total words, number of words in bi-grams, and the respective probabilities, including add-one smoothing probabilities displayed in table format. The second part involves sentiment analysis performed on the Twitter Airline Sentiment Dataset retrieved from Kaggle. This section utilizes the NLTK sentiment analyzer and compares various classification models like Logistics Regression, SGDClassifier with L1/L2 regularization, Ridge Classifier, Perceptron, MultinomialNB, Bernoulli NB, and Complement NB, assessing their performance metrics for sentiment classification.
